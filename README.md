# WK1: Code Challenge

Challenge for week 1 had three tasks to test beginner skills in Javascript.

### Prerequisites
* node v14.17.4 and above
* npm 6.14.14 and above
* Vue 2.6.11
* Then install the various packages from package.json `npm install`
* Create environment variables

### Tasks:

#### Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)
Prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then  it outputs the correct grade and if the input happens to be outside the range it outputs invalid: 

A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.

#### Challenge 2: Speed Detector (Toy Problem)
Takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it prints “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it gives the driver one demerit point and prints the total number of demerit points.

For instance, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.

 

#### Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator (Toy Problem)
Major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary. It calculates the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIFDeductions, NSSFDeductions, gross salary, and net salary. 
NB: Uses KRA, NHIF, and NSSF values provided in the link below.
